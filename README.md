# twitter_visualization
Simple application to visualize Twitter trends over a certain time period

## Files
trends.py - program for capturing trend data

visualization.py - program for visualizing trend data on a graph

TwitterMap.py - program that creates a relationship map based on two specified twitter accounts. The program displays these accounts and the relationships between accounts following them. Can be edited to display all relationships or just those common between accounts.

### Results/Progress
Trend visualization works, need to update so that the number of trends doesn't affect the visibility of unique trends on the graph. Possibly add some hover functionality as well for further interaction.

TwitterMap works, may be experiencing some weird problems with lines not being drawn between all common friends.
